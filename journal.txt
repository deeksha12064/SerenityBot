Today's session was a brave and emotional exploration of a challenging day. You shared with me the difficulties you faced and the overwhelmed feelings that came with them. I offered a supportive and non-judgmental space for you to process your emotions, and we began to unpack the experiences that made your day particularly tough. It was clear that it took a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your struggles, and I'm proud of you for taking this important step. Remember, you're not alone, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
