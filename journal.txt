Today's session was a brave and emotional exploration of a challenging day. You shared with me the difficulties you faced and the overwhelmed feelings that came with them. I offered a supportive and non-judgmental space for you to process your emotions, and we began to unpack the experiences that made your day particularly tough. It was clear that it took a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your struggles, and I'm proud of you for taking this important step. Remember, you're not alone, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

In our session today, we explored your experiences with social anxiety when meeting new people. You shared that you often feel nervous and anxious in these situations, and we began to untangle the underlying thoughts and worries that contribute to these feelings. I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing your struggles with me, and I'm here to support you in a safe and non-judgmental space. We've only just begun to scratch the surface, and I'm looking forward to continuing our conversation in future sessions. Remember, you're not alone in this feeling, and we'll work together to develop strategies to help you feel more comfortable and confident in social situations.
